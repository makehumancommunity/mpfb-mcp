# History of completed efforts

A running log of development efforts that have **landed**. It is the finished counterpart to
[NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md), which tracks only the remaining/active work. When an effort is
completed its entry moves here (see the [lifecycle in CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#lifecycle)).

Entries are ordered by feature-request number. Each notes what was actually built; the
individual `NNN-*/README.md` subdirs remain the authoritative record of what was planned and
decided, and the standing [specifications/](../specifications/) remain the source of truth for
current behavior.

The initial `mpfb_create_human` proof of concept predates this feature-request process and
has no numbered entry here or in `done/`; see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for what it covers.

## [FR 001](done/001-mpfb-get-status/README.md) — `mpfb_get_status`

Landed the first introspection tool: `mpfb_get_status`, which takes no arguments and always
answers, classifying the connected Blender's MPFB install as `absent`, `not_initialized`
(loaded but `register()` never completed) or `ok`, and — when `ok` — reporting version, build
info, install path, configured paths, the data roots MPFB will actually search, installed asset
packs, Rigify availability and Blender version/platform/compatibility.

Beyond the tool itself, the effort split `mpfb_codegen.py`'s `sys.modules` scan out of the
raising bootstrap into a shared helper with two variants built on it — one that raises when MPFB
is unusable, one that classifies instead — and established two rules now recorded in
[architecture.md](../specifications/architecture.md#resolving-mpfb-from-generated-code):
resolving MPFB is two steps rather than one, and generated code must never reach a service by
importing an MPFB submodule, because some of them have import-time side effects.

**Landed without the manual verification pass its own Tests section calls for.** Live testing
against a running Blender was explicitly out of scope for the implementation, so the documented
field values rest on reading MPFB's source rather than on observation; unit tests cover the
generated code's branching by executing it against a stubbed `bpy` and stubbed `sys.modules`
entries. The outstanding checks are listed under "Verification status" in
[the request itself](done/001-mpfb-get-status/README.md#verification-status).
